# JSON - Javascript Object Notation
##Syntax
### json itself is a syntax for exchanging data
### where and how? - between a browser and a server

- JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
- JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

- Json is also used to parse the data from existing files or web browser
- The data can only be text - hence, json is text written in json format

#### Where does this syntax come from

- data in name/ value pairs is separated by commas
```
